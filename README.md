This project was part of the course 'Information Systems Analysis and Design'. This project aimed at stimulating a real-world cloths renting experience by leveraging Information Systems Designs concepts.

- As part of this project we designed a complete Information System for a designer clothing rental system to support its main business processes with detailed requirements definition, analysis, design specification, and User Interface templates.

- We formulated detailed requirements definition, outlined necessary functional and non-functional requirements using Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
- We Performed analysis and created design specifications using Use Cases, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), program structure charts, data dictionaries.
- We Implemented necessary (Data Definition Language) DDLs and (Data Modification Language) DMLs, SQL statements and made use of indexes for better performance.
- We Modeled the prototype of the final product using UI templates and tools.
